    <p>Hello and welcome. This page is designed to provide you with professional information about me. After earning my MLS (Master of Library Science) from Indiana University, I spent ten years as a librarian/cataloger at several institutions around the country. In March of 2016, I decided to embark upon a new path as a developer. I attended Prime Digital Academy and graduated in July of 2016. On this page you'll find my resume, links to some of the applications I've worked on/built, and various ways to contact me. Enjoy!</p>
